Master Mind is my coding project illustrating the progress I've made in my understanding of HTML/CSS, Javascript/Jquery.  I've organized the code in chunks of game progression for readability. I really wanted to organize all of it in arrays, but this is for my next challenge.  

The triumphs and failures I encountered were many. The difficulties I experienced included everything from functions running multiple times to nesting too many functions to finding lost brackets. I struggled with accomplishing a way to turn off the feedback buttons once they hit four dur to functions being called multiple times afterwards, for instance. It's was such a joy to solve every problem faced. I created my first nested for loop within a for loop. It was outragiously organic and intuitive for it to be the solution...and happened during the last day of my working on this project. This is encouraging. I'm still getting better: every. single. day.
